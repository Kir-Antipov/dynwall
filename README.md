`dynwall` is a simple tool that helps you quickly generate dynamic wallpapers for popular desktop environments like KDE Plasma or GNOME from two images of your choice. It doesn't require installation and can be used both as a graphical utility to achieve desired results easily and quickly, and as a CLI for better fine-tuning and automation.
